Manages the creation and configuration of 2D lights within the scene. {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_light_manager}{Light\+Manager}} handles the instantiation of light sprites for low-\/quality settings, applies lighting and shadow changes based on user preferences, and responds to settings updates. It integrates with the Godot engine and listens for changes in lighting and shadow quality, updating all managed Point\+Light2D instances accordingly.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Manages the creation and configuration of 2D lights within the scene. {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_light_manager}{Light\+Manager}} handles the instantiation of light sprites for low-\/quality settings, applies lighting and shadow changes based on user preferences, and responds to settings updates. It integrates with the Godot engine and listens for changes in lighting and shadow quality, updating all managed Point\+Light2D instances accordingly. 

Attach this node to your scene to enable dynamic light management. The manager automatically updates lights when settings change and supports both high and low quality lighting modes.

Applies any pending changes to the managed lights. This method updates the state of all lights managed by the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_light_manager}{Light\+Manager}} instance, ensuring that any modifications (such as intensity, color, position, or activation state) are reflected in the scene or rendering context. 

Call this method after making changes to light properties to ensure those changes take effect.
