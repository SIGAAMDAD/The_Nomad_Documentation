\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Bug\+Reporter}{Bug\+Reporter}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md0}
The \doxylink{class_bug_reporter}{Bug\+Reporter} allows players to send messages using a discord webhook. ~\newline
 This allows easy and low maintanance feedback from directly inside your game. ~\newline
 Webhooks can be easily abused for anonymous automated spam. That makes this a bad solution for games with many players.\hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Config}{Config}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md1}
This is an example config with all needed values. Only the url is needed. game\+\_\+name will default to "{}unnamed\+\_\+game"{} if not specified.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{[webhook]}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{url="{}https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<webhook.id>/<webhook.token>"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{game\_name="{}BugReporter"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{tts=false}
\DoxyCodeLine{color=15258703}
\DoxyCodeLine{anonymous\_players=false}
\DoxyCodeLine{send\_log=false}
\DoxyCodeLine{send\_analytics=true}

\end{DoxyCode}


The Reporter Node also gives the option to change the path to the config file, disable auto closing and disable auto clearing for inputs.

{\bfseries{WARNING\+:}} The webhook url can be used to read all messages send with the webhook. ~\newline
 Do NOT use the url directly if you allow sending any non anonymous information. ~\newline
 Using the url for anonymous messages is still highly discouraged. ~\newline
 See Proxy section for save usage. \hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Example usage}{Example usage}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md2}
  

The playerid depends on the Game name and device id. This allows you to search reports by player but they are still mostly anonymous. You can disable this entirely with {\ttfamily anonymous\+\_\+players=true} ~\newline
 If not provided Contact Info will not be displayed. ~\newline
 You can add or remove as many Categories as you like by editing the Option\+Button of the Reporter. ~\newline
 F2 takes a screenshot (configurable with the input action {\ttfamily screenshot}). The screenshot can be attached to the message. ~\newline
\hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Analytics}{Analytics}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md3}
Most of the time a screenshot is not enough to figure out what happened in a bugreport. ~\newline
 To help with that you can allow your players to send analytics with their report. ~\newline
 The Analytics Report will look something like this. ~\newline
 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Report-\/1692997835-\/Linux-\/16-\/3}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{root/Example}
\DoxyCodeLine{Example:<Node2D\#27682407576>}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{root/Example/Player}
\DoxyCodeLine{pos:\ (539,\ 55),\ texture:\ res://icon.png}

\end{DoxyCode}
 It starts with the Header {\ttfamily Report-\/\+Timestamp-\/\+OS name} ~\newline
 Then it lists all nodes in the {\ttfamily analize} group by printing their full node path and the result of their {\ttfamily analize()} (Like root/\+Example/\+Player) function if they have one or the result of {\ttfamily \+\_\+to\+\_\+string()} (Like root/\+Example). ~\newline
 You can put anything in here but you should beware of data protection laws. ~\newline


This can be enabled with {\ttfamily send\+\_\+analytics} in the config file. \hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{log files}{log files}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md4}
For an easyer to setup variant you can also just send the godot.\+log file. Again you should beware of data protection laws.

This can be enabled with {\ttfamily send\+\_\+log} in the config file. Make sure to enable {\ttfamily application/run/flush\+\_\+stdout\+\_\+on\+\_\+print} in the Project settings. Otherwise the file will not always be written instantly. Then the log might miss lines at the end or be completely empty. Also set {\ttfamily debug/file\+\_\+logging/enable\+\_\+file\+\_\+logging} to make sure logs are written on non desktop platforms if needed.\hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Customisation}{Customisation}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md5}
\hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Message}{Message}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md6}
The looks of the final Message can be entirely customized by changing the {\ttfamily send\+\_\+report()} function in the {\ttfamily reporter.\+gd} script and using the {\ttfamily Webhook\+Builder} provided with {\ttfamily \+\_\+webhook}. \hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{UI}{UI}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md7}
The Reporter UI can be easily customized as long as the correct nodes are still provided in the main {\ttfamily Reporter} node. \hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{More specific questions}{More specific questions}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md8}
More information, questions etc can be freely added by first adding the input nodes (like buttons, Line\+Edit, etc.) and then adding the information to the message by adding a field, embed or whatever.\hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Example subnautica like}{Example subnautica like}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md9}
As example for an alternatve you can look at {\ttfamily subnautica\+\_\+like.\+tscn}. ~\newline
 It more closely resembles the feedback form in subnautica that inspired this addon. ~\newline
   ~\newline
\hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Example survey}{Example survey}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md10}
If you want feedback as more of a survey style format you can use {\ttfamily survey.\+tscn}   \mbox{[}\mbox{]}(screenshots/survey\+\_\+message.\+png) ~\newline
 Supports translations, optional questions, required questions, custom greeting \& goodbye, and easily customized questions and answers.\hypertarget{README.MD_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Proxy}{Proxy}}\label{README.MD_autotoc_md11}
To prevent data leaks and potential data privacy lawsuits you need to setup a proxy. A Proxy will relay any messages to discord while ignoring unwanted actions (reading, deleting etc.). ~\newline


The recomended way is to use a cloudflare worker with this code. Then put the proxy url in the webhook.\+cfg instead of the webhook url. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{export\ default\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ async\ fetch(request)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ const\ destinationURL\ =\ "{}webhook\ url"{};}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ if\ (request.method\ ===\ "{}POST"{})\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ const\ mod\ =\ await\ fetch(destinationURL,\ request);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ return\ new\ Response(null,\ \{status:\ mod.status\});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ return\ new\ Response("{}Only\ POST\ is\ allowed"{},\ \{\ status:\ 403\ \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}

\end{DoxyCode}


Make sure the webhook url is only in this code to make sure nobody malicius can get a hold of it. ~\newline
 If you want to implement a content filter or spam prevention this would be a good place to do it.
